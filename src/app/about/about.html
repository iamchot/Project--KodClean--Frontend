    Our <span class="highlight-green">Story</span>
  </h2>
  <div class="content-box">
    <p>
      KodClean was founded by a group of food lovers who wanted to make eating clean easier and more enjoyable. We noticed that many people give up on clean eating because they think it’s too complicated or tasteless. That’s why we created KodClean — a place where you can find easy-to-follow recipes, affordable ingredients, and nutritional information that helps you stay on track without sacrificing flavor.
